Life is very short, the rivers and lakes are too big, the goal is still, let us bless each other on the road of growth.

In fact, the life of each of us is a world, even the most ordinary people have to work for the world in which he lives.

There is no one to resist, and it never succumbs to life. There is an ideal that illuminates the confusion, where it is filled with glory.

When a craftsman of a code looks back on the past, he does not repent because of his ignorance, and he is not ashamed of his inaction. In this way, when he is old, he can be proud to tell the world that I once injected code into life to create a wave of the Internet. Hey, it was a very crazy time. I left a wave of waves on the wave of waves or as heavy as a mountain.

2019 Come on, be the best yourself! ! !

#### About technology
It's not because I need to use what kind of domain knowledge to learn, but just plain I want to know, I want to figure it out. After I understand it, what value is there and how much wealth can be created. This is something I never care about. On the contrary, the feedback given by knowledge is the biggest.
